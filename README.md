## Plan to Solve the Problem

The objective of this analysis is to derive meaningful insights from the sales data of a retail business to optimize sales performance and profitability. The data consists of one main table: Regional Data.xlsx, which records the detailed information of the regional sales between sales rep and customer. By analyzing this data, the goal is to understand customer preferences, identify high-value products, and enhance sales strategies. The specific business problems we aim to address include:

#### 1. Total Sales, Units, Profits: 
- Evaluating the total sales, units sold, and overall profits to evaluate the financial health of the business.
  
#### 2. Sales Trend Analysis: 
- Analyzing sales trends on a yearly and monthly basis to understand seasonal patterns and make informed forecasts.
  
#### 3. Top 5 Products by Profit: 
- Identifying the top 5 products by profit to prioritize high-margin items and enhance profitability.
  
#### 4. Purchases by Sales Bin: 
- Understanding the distribution of purchases across different sales bins to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior and sales segmentation.
  
#### 5. Customer Sales Analysis: 
- Examining customer sales to identify key customer segments and tailor marketing strategies to boost customer engagement and retention.
